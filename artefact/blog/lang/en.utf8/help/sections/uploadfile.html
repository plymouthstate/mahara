<h3>Upload File</h3>
<p>You may attach any number of files to a Blog posting. Files added to a  Blog posting are automatically stored within your file repository area in a  folder called &#8216;blogfiles&#8217; and contribute to your file storage quota.</p>
<p>If you upload a file then Cancel the posting or close the Blogs area without  saving, those files will also be removed from your file repository.</p>
<p>If you upload an image to a Blog posting, you can use the Image button  within the HTML editor to embed it into your post. You will be able to select the size,  alignment, border and space around the image using the fields provided.</p>
<p>You can also embed an image as a link from another website. You can either enter in the URL of the image  or &#8216;drag and drop&#8217; the image from the website into the HTML editor. Please ensure you have appropriate copyright  permission to use this image.</p>
<p>For best results images should be no more than 400x400 pixels and have  less than 5 pixels of padding on each side.</p>
