<h3>Friends Control</h3>
<p>Choose whether other users may add you to their friends list. If you are added to a friends list, the owner of that list is added to your list. When you remove someone from your friends list you are also removed from their list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add me as a friend:</strong> no one may add you to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends require my authorisation:</strong> your authorisation is needed for you to be added to a list. If you approve, they will be added to your list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add you to their list.</p>
