<h3>Display remote avatars</h3>

<p>If this option is enabled,
the <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> online service will be
used to display profile icons for users who don't have one set in
Mahara. This allows users to set their profile icon once on the Gravatar
site instead of having to do it on every Mahara and online service
individually. (If Gravatar doesn't have an icon for that user, then the
default Mahara icon will be shown.)</p>

<h4>Reasons to turn it off</h4>

<p>This option should be disabled in installations (such as locked-down
intranets) where <b>users don't have access to the wider Internet</b>. Using
Gravatar in such an environment would simply add extra delays.</p>

<p>Also, for <b>sites delivered over https</b>, enabling Gravatar profile
icons might trigger security warnings on some browsers. This is due to the
fact that Gravatar images are served via normal unencrypted http.</p>

<h4>Custom avatar server</h4>

<p>If you have a custom avatar server which implements the Gravatar
protocol, you may specify its base url in your config.php file:</p>

<p><code>$cfg->remoteavatarbaseurl = 'http://example.com/avatar/';</code></p>
