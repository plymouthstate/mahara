<h3>Publicly Viewable Group</h3>
<p>If you say yes, most sections of your group will be viewable by anyone who visits your group - including people who do not have an account on this site.</p>
<p>Everyone will be able to see the group member listing, and see all discussions in the forums. However, people will still have to become a member of the group before they can post to the forums.</p>
<p>Regardless of this setting, your group file section and all files inside it will remain private.</p>
