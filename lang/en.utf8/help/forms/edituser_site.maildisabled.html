<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Users can choose whether to receive e-mail or not.</p>
<p>If e-mail is disabled for a user, they will still receive messages using
the built-in messaging system.</p>
<p>Depending on your setup, if e-mails are bounced back to the sender,
then e-mail may be automatically disabled.</p>
