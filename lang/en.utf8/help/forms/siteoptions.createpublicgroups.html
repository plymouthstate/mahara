<h3>Publicly Viewable Groups</h3>
<p>If you wish to allow all users to create groups that may be viewed by people who are not members of your site, set this option to 'Everyone'.</p>
<p>In a public group, anyone who finds your site (including search engines) will be able to see the group &quot;about&quot; page, the member listing, and see all discussions in the forums. However, people will still have to become a member of the site before they can peform other actions, such as posting to the forums or viewing user profiles.</p>
