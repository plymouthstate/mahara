<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>You can add tags to views you create. Tags are labels or keywords that you can use to classify and search for views.</p>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Show my tags</strong> will generate a list of the tags you have previously used and the number of items they have been applied to. Clicking on a tag in this list will add it to the tags for this view, or remove it if you have already tagged the view with this tag.</p>
