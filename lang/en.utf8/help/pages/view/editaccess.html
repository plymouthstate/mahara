<h3>Edit View Access</h3>
<p>You can control who has access to your View, and when. By default, only you can see your View. You can share your view with the Public, Logged in Users, or your Friends by clicking the appropriate Add button. You can also assign access to individual Groups or Users by using the search tool.</p>
<p>Access dates can be specified, allowing you to make your View available for a specified period such as a course year, a project timeline, or even for one day. All dates are optional. Individual users can be granted access by multiple access rules.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Nigel is in the group "The Coolpeople's Club". If you allow him to access your View today, and allow The Coolpeople's Club to access your View tomorrow, he will be able to access the view on both days.</p>
