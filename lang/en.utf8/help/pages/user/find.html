<h3>Find Friends</h3>
<p>This page lets you search for users to add as friends. Depending on their friendship control settings you may be automatically accepted as their friend or you may need to send a friendship request. Some users may not allow friendship requests at all.</p>
<p>When sending a friendship request you can choose to include a short message introducing yourself. This is especially important if you have a Display Name set, as others will not see your real name.</p>
