// MAHARA CONFIGURATION FILE
//
// Copy this file from config-dist.php to config.php, and change the values in 
// it to suit your environment.
//
// Information about this file is available on the Mahara wiki:
// http://wiki.mahara.org/System_Administrator's_Guide/Installing_Mahara#Create_Mahara's_config.php
//

$cfg = new StdClass;


// database connection details
// valid values for dbtype are 'postgres8' and 'mysql5'
$cfg->dbtype   = 'postgres8';
$cfg->dbhost   = 'localhost';
$cfg->dbport   = null;
$cfg->dbname   = '';
$cfg->dbuser   = '';
$cfg->dbpass   = '';

// Note: database prefix is NOT required, you don't need to set one except if 
// you're installing Mahara into a database being shared with other 
// applications (this happens most often on shared hosting)
$cfg->dbprefix = '';

// wwwroot - the web-visible path to your Mahara installation
// Normally, this is automatically detected - if it doesn't work for you
// then try specifying it here
//$cfg->wwwroot = 'http://myhost.com/mahara/';

// You will only need to specify this if you want to use HTTPS for
// logins, but not for regular pages. If you want to serve all of your
// Mahara content via HTTPS, just set $cfg->wwwroot to use HTTPS instead.
//$cfg->httpswwwroot = 'https://myhost.com/mahara';

// dataroot - uploaded files are stored here
// This is a ABSOLUTE FILESYSTEM PATH. This is NOT a URL.
// For example, valid paths are:
//  * /home/user/maharadata
//  * /var/lib/mahara
//  * c:\maharadata
// INVALID paths:
//  * http://yoursite/files
//  * ~/files
//  * ../data
//
// This path must be writable by the webserver and outside document root (the 
// place where the Mahara files like index.php have been installed).
// Mahara will NOT RUN if this is inside your document root, because
// this is a big security hole.
$cfg->dataroot = '/path/to/uploaddir';

// If set, this email address will be displayed in the error message if a form
// submission is suspected of being spam. This reduces the frustration for the
// user in the event of a false positive.
$cfg->emailcontact = '';

// closing php tag intentionally omitted to prevent whitespace issues
