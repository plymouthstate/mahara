<h3>Edit Page</h3>
<p>Designing your page layout enables you to personalise the way in which your resources and information can be displayed. For example if you wish to display only one of your Journal entries, click on the Journals tab, then drag the Journal Entry block into your page area. Remember to click Save as you add new elements to your page.</p>
<p>As you build up the content of your layout you can check on how it will look by clicking on 'Display my page'. Click on 'Back to create my page' to continue editing.</p>
