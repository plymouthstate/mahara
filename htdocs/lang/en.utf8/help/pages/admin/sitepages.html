<h3>Site pages</h3>
<p>The core pages of a Mahara installation may be edited dynamically by a Site Administrator.  If you wish to customise the content of a core page (About, Home, Logged Out Home, Privacy Statement, Terms and Conditions and the Upload Copyright Statement) from the default text select the page you wish to modify and edit using the HTML editor.  Ensure you Save Changes before loading another editable page or exiting the Site Pages area.</p>
