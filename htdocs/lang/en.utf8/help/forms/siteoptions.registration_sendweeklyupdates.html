<h3>Send Weekly Updates</h3>
<p>If you tick &quot;send weekly updates&quot;, Mahara will automatically send an update to mahara.org once a week with updated information about your installation.</p>
<p>The information sent is high level statistical information - no personal information about any of your users is sent. You can review the type of information that is sent before you register your Mahara site (which you can do from the admin home page).</p>
