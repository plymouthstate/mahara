// CONFIGURATION DEFAULTS
//
// Do Not Edit This File!
//
// If you see a setting in here you'd like to change, copy it to your 
// config.php and change it there.
//
// This file sets defaults that are useful for most people.
//

$cfg = new StdClass;

// directorypermissions - what permissions to use for files and directories in 
// dataroot. The default allows only the web server user to read the data. If 
// you're on shared hosting and might want to download the contents of your 
// dataroot later (e.g. for backup purposes), set this to 0777. Otherwise, 
// leave it as is!
//$cfg->directorypermissions = 0700;

// insecuredataroot - whether to enforce checking that files being served have 
// come from dataroot. You would only want to turn this on if you were running 
// more than one Mahara against the same dataroot. If you are doing that, make 
// sure you create separate dataroots for each installation, but symlink the 
// artefact directory from all of them to one of them, and turn on 
// 'insecuredataroot' on all the ones you created symlinks for.
//
// If you don't know what you're doing/didn't understand the paragraph above, 
// then leave this setting alone!
//$cfg->insecuredataroot = false;

// system mail address. emails out come from this address.
// if not specified, will default to noreply@ automatically detected host.
// if that doesn't work or you want something else, then specify it here.
// $cfg->noreplyaddress = 'noreply@myhost.com';

// Logging configuration
// For each log level, you can specify where the messages are displayed.
//
// LOG_TARGET_SCREEN makes the error messages go to the screen - useful
// when debugging but not on a live site!
// LOG_TARGET_ADMIN sends error messages to the screen but only when
// browsing in the admin section
// LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG makes the error messages go to the log as specified
// by the apache ErrorLog directive. It's probably useful to have this on
// for all log levels.
// LOG_TARGET_FILE allows you to specify a file that messages will be logged
// to. It's best to pick a path in dataroot, but note that logfiles tend to get
// very large over time - so it's advisable to implement some kind of logrotate
// if you want to leave this on all the time. The other option is to just turn
// this on when you are getting some kind of error or want to see the logging,
// and know that you're not going to let the logfile get large.
//
// You can combine the targets with bitwise operations,
// e.g. LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG
//
// This configuration is suitable for people running Mahara for the first
// time. You will immediately see environment errors, and so can correct
// them. You will be able to see other debugging information in your error
// logs. Once your site is up and running you might want to remove the
// environment level logging completely, and just log everything else to
// the error log.
$cfg->log_dbg_targets     = LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
$cfg->log_info_targets    = LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
$cfg->log_warn_targets    = LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
$cfg->log_environ_targets = LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
// This configuration is suitable for developers. You will see all errors
// and they will also be in the logs.
//$cfg->log_dbg_targets     = LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
//$cfg->log_info_targets    = LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
//$cfg->log_warn_targets    = LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;
//$cfg->log_environ_targets = LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG;

// If you use LOG_TARGET_FILE, this is the file that errors will be logged to.
// By default, it will write to the file 'error.log' under dataroot. If you
// change this in config.php, make sure you use a folder which is writable by
// the webserver.
// $cfg->log_file = '/path/to/dataroot/error.log';

// The log levels that will generate backtraces. Useful for development,
// but probably only warnings are useful on a live site.
$cfg->log_backtrace_levels = LOG_LEVEL_WARN | LOG_LEVEL_ENVIRON;

// Developer mode
// When set, the following things (among others) will happen:
//
// * 'debug.js' will be included on each page. You can edit this file to add 
//   debugging javascript at your discretion
// * 'debug.css' will be included on each page. You can edit this file to add 
//   debugging CSS at your discretion
// * the unpacked version of MochiKit will be used
//
// These options are a performance hit otherwise, enable when you are 
// developing for Mahara
$cfg->developermode = false;
// $cfg->developermode = DEVMODE_DEBUGJS | DEVMODE_DEBUGCSS | DEVMODE_UNPACKEDJS;

// Whether to send e-mail. If set to false, Mahara will not send any e-mail at 
// all. This is useful for when setting up development versions of Mahara where 
// you don't want to accidentally send email to users from this particular 
// Mahara installation.
//
// You can use sendallemailto to have all e-mails from this instance of Mahara 
// sent to one particular address instead of where they're aimed for. Leave 
// sendemail = true if you want to use this setting.
$cfg->sendemail = true;
// $cfg->sendallemailto = 'you@example.com';
//
// Log basic details of emails sent out by Mahara.  Must be writable by the
// webserver user.  This will get big.
// $cfg->emaillog = '/path/to/dataroot/email.log';

// capture performance information and print it
// $cfg->perftofoot = true; // needs a call to mahara_performance_info (smarty callback) - see default theme's footer.tpl
// $cfg->perftolog = true;
// if neither are set, performance info wont be captured.

// Mail handling
// If you want mahara to use SMTP servers to send mail, enter one or more here
// blank means mahara will use the default PHP method.
// $cfg->smtphosts = 'smtp1.example.com;smtp2.example.com';
// If smtp server uses port number different from 25 (e.g. for secure connections,
// port 465 is usually used with ssl, port 587 is usually used with tls),
// specify it below. Alternatively you may specify the port in smtphosts
// definition above using format [hostname:port] (e.g. 'smtp1.example.com:465').
// $cfg->smtpport = 25;
// If you have specified an smtp server above, and the server requires
// authentication, enter user credentials here:
// $cfg->smtpuser = '';
// $cfg->smtppass = '';
// If smtp server requres secure connection, specify the protocol type below.
// Valid options are '', 'ssl' or 'tls'. Setting it to '' or leaving the line
// commented means that secure connection will not be used.
// $cfg->smtpsecure = '';

// Variable Envelope Return Path Handling
// If you want mahara to keep track of email addresses which generate a
// bounce, set bounces_handle to true.
// If set to true, $cfg->bouncedomain *must* be set.
$cfg->bounces_handle  = false;
// Rather than disable an email address on the first bounce message,
// require bounces_min bounces.
$cfg->bounces_min     = 5;
// Require at least (bounces_ratio*100)% of sent mail to be bounced back
// before disabling mail for that user.
// e.g. If using the default bounces_ratio of 0.20 and 20 mails are sent to
// a user, at least 4 must be returned before email is disabled.
$cfg->bounces_ratio   = 0.20;
// Identity of the Mahara instance
// This prefix must be four characters.
// If you have several Mahara, Moodle, or other VERP processors on the same
// bounce domain, you need to keep track of which processor belongs to
// which domain.
