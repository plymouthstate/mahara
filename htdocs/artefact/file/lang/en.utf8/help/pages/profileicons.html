<h3>Profile Pictures</h3>
<p>
    The Profile Pictures area allows you to upload Pictures that will appear beside
    your name in many places in the system.
</p>
<p>
    You may have up to 5 pictures in your Profile Pictures area at once. Pictures you
    upload must be at least 16x16 pixels and no greater than 1024x1024 pixels.
    The images you upload count towards your file quota.
</p>
<p>
    Your default icon will be shown to other people beside your name around the
    site, and you may use the other images in the pages you create.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> All of your profile pictures (not just the default one)
    can be accessed by other logged in users. Delete them if you do not want
    others to see them.
